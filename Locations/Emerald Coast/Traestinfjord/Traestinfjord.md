## Religion
Traestinfjord is an isolated place. Most of the locals worship minor elemental spirits who are said to inhabit the mountains around them.

Local legends speak of the great serpent Vistaru who once ruled this land and demanded worship. There are still some worshipers of Vistaru around, but since it has been so long since anyone has actually seen Vistaru, Traestinfjord has mostly forgotten about him.

## Plot Hooks
### Missing Sheep
A local shepherd complains that his sheep have been disappearing. He suspects a population of [[Creatures#Wolf|Wolves]] have moved into the region. He wants to get a group of the locals together to make a trip into the forest to hunt down and kill the beasts.

## Slumbering Serpent
Deep beneath the waters of the fjord, Vistaru, an [[Monsters#Adult Green Dragon|Adult Green Dragon]] slumbers in his underwater lair. Will he wake? And how will he feel when he finds the population above has all but forgotten his name?

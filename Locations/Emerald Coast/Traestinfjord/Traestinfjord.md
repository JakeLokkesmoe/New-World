## Religion
Traestinfjord is an isolated place. Most of the locals worship minor elemental spirits who are said to inhabit the mountains around them.

Local legends speak of the great serpent [[Vistaru]] who once ruled this land and demanded worship. There are still some worshipers of [[Vistaru]] around, but since it has been so long since anyone has actually seen [[Vistaru]], Traestinfjord has mostly forgotten about him.

## Plot Hooks
### Missing Sheep
A local shepherd complains that his sheep have been disappearing. He suspects a population of have moved into the region. He wants to get a group of the locals together to make a trip into the forest to hunt down and kill the beasts.

# The Emerald Coast
*Region - SOMEWHERE*

A land of deep, clear fjords and rolling, verdant, grassy hills that rise to sharp craggily peaks; the Emerald Coast is home to a hearty, independent folk. Originally settled by halflings, the Emerald Coast has since developed a diverse population of dwarves, elves, humans, and others; drawn to the coast for its promise of a simple quiet life.

The sharp mountains, and deep fjords make this an isolated land of primarily rural communities full of shepherds and fisherman. But in some of the larger fjords, larger cities can be found. Some of these large cities have developed into havens for piracy, as the narrow fjord entrances and difficult surrounding terrain make them almost impregnable to the civilized navies of the world.

The vibrant Cyranan Pines dotting the mountainsides give the Emerald Coast both its name and its primary export, lumber for shipbuilding. Growing tall and straight, Cyranan Pine is a favorite material for creating masts by shipbuilders everywhere.
